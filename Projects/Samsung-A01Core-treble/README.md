# Short description
I had to learn a little how to burn GSI on this device, which does not have official fastboot support, you can read a little more about the process on my blog.

in short; You can burn GSI through a custom [recovery that supports fastbootd](https://github.com/AshiVered/Android-custom-ROMs/releases/tag/a01core), or with the [tar file](https://github.com/AshiVered/Android-custom-ROMs/releases/tag/a01core_super) I prepared (no tested yet).


##Known bugs

1. MTP now working
2. wired headset not working
3. wireless headset not working
4. If the device is off, and you connect it to the charger, to turn it on you will have to press the power button and volume up (together) for a few seconds, until the phone vibrates, then turn it on normally.
